## Install Database 
First install the database "PostgreSQL". You can download it on https://www.postgresql.org/

Then you have to init the tables. You will find the sql-file in the backend folder. The file is called "init.sql"

Second you have to import the necessary "csv"-files. You will also find them in the backend folder. A process which describes the import process can be found on following link https://hevodata.com/learn/postgresql-import-csv/ (method 2 worked fine in our case). In case you receive a "binary path"-error this clip should help you https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cBkXKCY4Ew&ab_channel=JunaidQaiser
